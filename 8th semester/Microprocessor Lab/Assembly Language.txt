Lab 2 | Basic Arithmetic Operation
-------------------------------------
1. For A=1, B=2,C=3 calculate 2A+2B-C using assembly language.
2. Write an assembly language procedure to swap the values of two registers.

Lab 3 | 
-------------------------------------
1. Assembly language for dividing the value of a register by 4.
2. Assembly language for converting an upper case letter into a lower case letter and vice versa.
3. Assembly language for checking if values of two registers are equal or not.
4. Assembly language for multiplying the value of a register by 5.


PRACTICE
----------------------
1) 2A+B-C
2) SWAP TWO REGISTER
3) INCREMENT
4) Upper case to Lower case, Lower case to Upper case
5) Compare two values and shows is the values are less than, greater or
equal
6) Shift left for multiply and shift right for division.
